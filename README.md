# Project Name: COVID-19 vaccination rates of different ethnic groups in the US

# Project Proposal
# Story Pitch
For our project, we want to tell a story about the struggles people of color face when accessing medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, people of color in America have always been subject to discrimination and systemic oppression, preventing them from having the same access to opportunities and basic human needs like proper housing and healthcare. 

This story is important and something we care about because it shows us how people of color are disproportionately affected by something as essential as healthcare. Vaccinations were designed to help people have a better shot at combating covid and should be accessible to all. Although there are many different beliefs regarding vaccinations, lower vaccine rates in POC communities may result from not being correctly informed on the disease or how or where to get hold of vaccines. Higher vaccine rates in white communities could suggest that they receive more education on vaccination and have more access to vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic has had destructive effects on the entire world, but its impact has highlighted the disparity in overall healthcare access that marginalized communities face. Through this study, we want to highlight how this disparity presents itself in the United States. COVID-19 continues to affect people today, and the risk of new large-scale health issues is pervasive. Through this project, we hope to raise awareness of how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people of color, taking the first step towards increasing healthcare equity in the United States.

For our project, we will use county-wise COVID-19 vaccination rates data from the CDC and county population demographics data from the Census. We will analyze data observations starting in December 2020, when the COVID-19 vaccine was released publicly. To sample the data more accurately, we decided to focus on counties in the United States. By focusing on smaller groups of people, we can categorize each group more accurately based on the ethnicity of the group’s majority. 

The questions we want to explore are:
* Is a person’s race correlated with their likelihood of being vaccinated against COVID-19?
* Is there a difference between the vaccination rates of counties that have a majority of white residents compared to counties with a majority of POC residents?
* What differences in vaccination rates are present between different groups of people of color?

# Finding Data

## Dataset 1
[Link to dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 

[Link to data dictionary](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/files/355b5160-7bd0-47bb-95ca-3c361fe758f9?download=true&filename=DataDictionary_v36_12082022.xlsx)


The first dataset consists of 80 features and 1,952,932 observations. The data was collected through vaccine administration and delivery data reports provided by each county’s jurisdiction or vaccination partners. The dataset is updated weekly with the vaccination rates of both the total vaccination rate of a county, as well as information on sub-groups like different age groups or people at different stages in the vaccination process. 


## Dataset 2

The second dataset consists of 80 features and 179,151 observations. The data was generated through a cohort-component method, collecting information on the population base, births, deaths, and migration to calculate a population estimate. It consists of county-wise racial demographic estimates recorded at 3 different times: April 1, 2020, July 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021. The dataset also includes racial demographic estimates for age sub-groups. For this study, we are going to use the latest demographic data recorded in 2021 to ensure our analysis is as accurate as possible.

* This article highlights the different COVID-19 death rates in different racial groups, specifically African-Americans. Like our story pitch, the article compares different racial groups and how COVID-19 has affected them.

* In contrast, this article focuses on the death rate, while we are comparing the different vaccination rates between the groups.

* This article focuses on the risk rate of COVID-19 in POC, similar to what we are trying to look for when comparing the vaccination rates of different racial groups.
* In contrast, this article looks at the risk rate while we are observing vaccination rates.

* This link focuses on the effects of COVID-19 in an economic sense and comparing the effects between black and white households. Comparing the two racial groups is similar to what we are aiming to do as well.
* In contrast, this article explores the economic effects of COVID-19 while we are studying vaccination rates.

* This article shows the studies of initial test trials of COVID-19 vaccines on POC, and how many different participants there were of each race. While the trials take a medical approach, they are also similar to our story pitch as they focus on vaccines.
* It also compares the representation of POC in these test trials and if there was enough representation.

* This link consists of data on the COVID-19 vaccination rates by race in King County, which follows the same idea of our story pitch.
* Instead of only King County, we are planning to look for trends in all the counties in the United States.
